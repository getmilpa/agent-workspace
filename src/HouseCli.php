/**
 * The CLI as a person types it to reach THIS house — asked of the house, never decided here.
 *
 * In the Desktop the house lives in a container, so `php bin/coa …` runs only after
 * `docker exec -it <container>`. The process that serves the house declares that way in and
 * `milpa/app-runtime` builds every command it hands a person from `Capabilities::cli()`
 * (greenhouse decisions/0559, E5). The workspace kept two commands of its own, as catalog values —
 * the way out of a write nobody can judge, and the probe for a degraded hub — and they went on saying
 * `php bin/coa` (greenhouse decisions/0560).
 *
 * 🚨 ONE JUDGE. What a declared way in may be — no line break, no `;`, no `$`, 200 characters — is
 * app-runtime's judgement. This class reads no environment variable: a second reader would be a
 * second filter, and the one that forgets a character is the one somebody copies a line from.
 *
 * The workspace requires app-runtime only to test itself, so the class is named by string, as
 * {@see Data\DesktopData} names the ones it reads. With no app-runtime, or one from before it could
 * say, the answer is `php bin/coa ` and every text is returned as it was given.
